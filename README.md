# server-status-shell
A simple shell script to check current load and memory usage on a Ubuntu server.

You can save this script to a file, for example server_status.sh, and make it executable by running the following command:
```
chmod +x server_status.sh
```

You can then run the script to check the current load and memory usage on your Ubuntu server:
```
./server_status.sh
```

This will print the current load and memory usage to the terminal, for example:
```
Current load: 0.12, 0.07, 0.07
Memory usage: Total: 8192MB, Used: 4983MB, Free: 3208MB
```
